# a-house-for-a-fly
Unity3d VR experience
A house for a fly is an intimate room scale VR experience that tells the story of Lila, a 6-year-old girl who discovers she is locked in a room with only a sleeping baby and a fly for to keep her company. Sweet and compelling, you are drawn into a bedroom in a rural mountain house in post-war northern Spain where you learn about Lilaâ€™s life and imagination through the objects around you.
